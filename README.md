### What I learned

```css

#price-1 {
    text-decoration: line-through;
}

svg {
    display: inline-block;
    vertical-align: middle;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 375px){

    .img{
        content: url("images/image-product-mobile.jpg");
    }
    
}
```
### Continued development

I want to learn more about responsive design because i'm still not good at it, so i can move to learn other things.
